# rowdy-bio
A project that I decided to work on for rowdy hacks.


## Purpose
I this is a project for a hackathon. I wanted to make like a personal business card online that you can post on your bio so you don't have to copy and paste everything for each online account you make.

### Features
List of features that will be made available on the website
- general information (name, age,etc...)
- Bio
- interests
- Personal FAQ
- choose from four special biome backgrounds

## Possible problems
Since i'll most likely be doing this solo, I won't really have the knowledge for everything. 
The only knowledge i have is setting up a webserver with AWS, a database server, and linking my domain to the site.
Here is a list of things I might not know how to do. 
- how to make the database schema for the project
- how to make it look presentable (nice css and javascript)
- how to set up everything with google cloud
- how to store passwords 

### Progress overtime
2:00 pm - Creating the git repository, creating storyboard, and wireframing
